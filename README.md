# Description

Create three html pages with a active navbar that has working links.
Split the three pages up into rows and columns and design those three pages using bootsrap.
Finally use CSS at the end to make everything look nice and pretty.
Make sure there is a footer at the bottom of each page.

## Installation

Add the repository to your GitHub account.
make the repo root master so that we can publish our site.

## Usage

All images should be shown and scale to fit as the user adjusts the screen size.
If you need to contact me fill in the desired fielsds, and click the submit button.
